# AccessMover

**AccessMover** is a Windows-only Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides two powerful features in one tool:

1. **Permissions Manager (Access Control)**  
   - Recursively grants **Full Control** file permissions to the current user and **Everyone** (or the `S-1-1-0` SID).  
   - Options for taking ownership, enabling inheritance, including or excluding the root folder, and skipping **AppData**.  

2. **Data Copy Tool (Mover)**  
   - Copies user files (Photos, Documents, Music, Videos, QuickBooks, or complete User Profiles) to a safe destination.  
   - Options for minimum file size, canceling scans, progress display, logging, and skipping **AppData**.
